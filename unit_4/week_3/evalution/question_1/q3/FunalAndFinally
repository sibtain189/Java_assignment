1. Final:-
    a) the final keyword is useful when we want a variable to always store the same value.
    b) It is non-access modifier for classes and methods which makes them non-changeable(Can't inherit and override).
    example -- the value of PI(3.14)

2. Finally:-
    a) It is a part of exception which must be executed whether exception generated or not.
    b) if we don't want execute finally we can use "System.exit()".
